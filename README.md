# file_search_gui
This is a GUI-based file search application built using wxPython that allows users to:  Search a specified directory for files of a specific type (e.g., .pdf, .txt).  Save the list of found files, along with their creation dates, to a CSV file. Optionally, copy all found files to a separate folder.
